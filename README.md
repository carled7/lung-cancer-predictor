# lung-cancer-predictor

This repo is part of an Artificial Intelligence lesson that involves training several classification models with different algorithms, and implementing the most accurate one with a front-end interface to make new predictions.

This app was designed to consume [this API](https://github.com/carled7/lung-cancer-api.git) that implements a AI trained model and returns predicted results based on a set o variables which must be passed in a POST HTTP request.

Additionally, there is a small disclaimer text stating that the model may not be entirely accurate" width="270" />

It is a very simple application with only two screens as shown above.
